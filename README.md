Udemy Website Clone – Front-End Development Project
Project Overview

This project is a static, responsive clone of the Udemy website, created to demonstrate my front-end web development skills using HTML and CSS. The goal of the project was to replicate the layout, structure, and visual organization of Udemy’s homepage while maintaining clean, semantic code and responsive design principles.
